User Experience
	Used bootstrap/Angular directives to style the app, tried to use out of the box class/styles as much as possible
	UI navigation uses traditional UI routes as well as Pacemaker Restful routes using jquery and Angular
	Map interaction uses leaflet.js as I've used Google Maps before and wanted to use an open source alternative
	Used chart.js for charts
	-Date filters uses HTML5 input type datetime-local which is not supported in Firefox, or Internet Explorer 12 and earlier versions
	-Mixing UI strategies for UI - ie Angular and JQuery is not recommended but required to meet all assignment UX requirements (single page app not an option as UI routes required)
